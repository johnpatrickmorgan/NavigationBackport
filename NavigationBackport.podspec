  This package uses the navigation APIs available in older SwiftUI versions 
  (such as `NavigationView` and `NavigationLink`) to recreate the new `NavigationStack` APIs 
  introduced in WWDC22, so that you can start targeting those APIs on older versions of iOS, tvOS, 
  macOS and watchOS. When running on an OS version that supports `NavigationStack`, `NavigationStack` 
  will be used under the hood.
